AIM : A C program to simulate a bash shell with your own shell (eg: name_shell) that can implement
the following Linux commands with one option if mentioned with it.
(A) Basic terminal navigation commands:
a. ls (option: -a)
b. cd
(B) Displaying the file content on the terminal:
a. cat (option: -n)
(C) File and directory manipulation commands:
a. mkdir (option: -m)
b. cp (option: -u)
(D) Sort and filter data commands:
a. sort (option: -r)
b. grep (option: -n)

Note that:
1. name_shell should look exactly like normal linux terminal, where you can enter the
commands from standard input followed by its arguments.
2. name-shell prompt should look exactly like linux shell prompt showing its current working
directory. (eg: user@system_pc:~/Assignment1$).
3. Any illegal command or unrecognized argument should show a meaningful error to the user
without crashing name_shell.
4. name_shell should also support exit command to smoothly exit the shell by printing a
meaningful message without forcefully exiting the process.
5. name_shell should also support up and down arrows and should implement command
history. (**Hint: Use readline function in C).
6. For grep command implement a minimum of 4 arguments.
